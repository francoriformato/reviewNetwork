# reviewNetwork
Project developed for a friend, a platform where users can share reviews on their books and redeem Audible codes.
Sadly the development has been interrupted because of the impossibility to sell the product to the investor, that has changed his plans.
Anyway, it has been a great way to improve my understandings of nodeJS, EJS, Javascript, mongoDb (Atlas) and to implement a login/register strategy.
[More documentation on the project to come]
